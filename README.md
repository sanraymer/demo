## 📖 Project Description

**Eyes** is an iOS application designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting obstacles at different heights and distances using Apple’s built-in **LiDAR sensors**.

Through **real-time audio feedback**, the app provides an extra layer of awareness beyond the traditional white cane, specifically reducing the risk of collisions with overhead or elevated objects that a cane might miss.

> **Mission:** The project began with the idea of manufacturing and donating physical devices. To accelerate development and reach users sooner, we launched this iOS app first. Our long-term vision includes designing and donating dedicated hardware for broader accessibility.

## 📱 Features

### 🔊 Audio Feedback
The core of Eyes is its **Text-to-Speech system**. It automatically announces obstacle distances in centimeters (e.g., *"42"* for 42 cm) when an object enters the detection zone.

*See `TextToSpeech.swift` for detailed usage examples.*

### ⚡ Energy Optimization
Includes an option to automatically **turn off the screen** (black screen mode) during usage to significantly extend battery life while the LiDAR continues to scan.

## 🤳 Compatible Devices

This app relies on the **LiDAR scanner**. It is fully compatible with the following models:

| iPhone 12 Series | iPhone 13 Series | iPhone 14 Series | iPhone 15 Series | iPhone 16+ Series |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 12 Pro <br> 12 Pro Max | 13 Pro <br> 13 Pro Max | 14 Pro <br> 14 Pro Max | 15 Pro <br> 15 Pro Max | 16 Pro / Max <br> 17 Pro / Max |

## 🗺️ Roadmap (TO-DO)

- [x] **Audio Feedback** Real-time audio warnings for obstacle detection with distance announcement in centimeters.
- [x] **Energy Optimization** Add an option to automatically turn off the screen during usage to save battery.
- [ ] **AI-Powered Text Recognition** Enable real-time reading of text from books, signs, product labels, and everyday objects.
- [ ] **Object Recognition** Train the system to identify and describe common items:
  - 🪑 Furniture (chairs, tables, sofas)
  - 📺 Electronics (phones, computers, TVs)
  - 🚗 Transportation (cars, buses)
  - 🍎 Food & Packaging
- [ ] **Spatial Awareness Features** Implement precise distance and direction detection to describe the relative position of objects.
- [ ] **Navigation System with Map** Real-time GPS-based navigation with voice announcements and AR depth sensing integration.
- [ ] **Startup optimization**
